# Coursera_Capstone
This is for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone project, the last of a 9-course sequence on coursera.org.

In this project I performed cluster analyses on restaurant and brewery densities in the twin cities. I used the k-means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms to identify ideal locations to construct a new brewery.
